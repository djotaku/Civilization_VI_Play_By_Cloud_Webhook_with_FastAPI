# Civilization VI Play By Cloud (And Play Your Damn Turn) Webhook (with Python FastAPI)

Using Python FastAPI creates a webhook endpoint for Civilization VI's Play By Cloud or [Play Your Damn Turn](https://www.playyourdamnturn.com/) Webhooks. Also pushes notifications to Matrix.

Note: while there is no code right now - I have already created [this functionality with Flask](http://www.ericsbinaryworld.com/2021/03/01/programming-jan-feb-2021/#civ-vi-play-by-cloud-webhook), but on reddit someone told me that FastAPI would be much better for a simple JSON API program like this one. After looking at FastAPI's documentation - I agree that for this particular program - FastAPI would produce cleaner, self-documenting, easier to maintain code.
